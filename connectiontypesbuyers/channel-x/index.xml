        Channel-X extracts the product loaded by Channel Managers into our Inventory system and sends it to a third partner, normally an OTA. As a Buyer, you will have the option of loading all the product into your system by selecting the Full Copy tab in Inventory&amp;rsquo;s extranet, having the possibility to only select the hotels you are interested in copying. Also, each update the Channel Manager does, will be notified in a smaller product request, as you will only receive information that has changed.
