        Channel-X extracts the product loaded by Channel Managers into our Inventory system and sends it to a third partner, normally an OTA. As a Buyer, you will have the option of loading all the product into your system by selecting the Full Copy tab in Inventory&amp;rsquo;s extranet, having the possibility to only select the hotels you are interested in copying. Also, each update the Channel Manager does, will be notified in a smaller product request, as you will only receive information that has changed.

        The API described in this document is used to transmit rate, availability and inventory, data between Channel-X and a partner system. A full implementation of this API requires that the partner system provides a service endpoint that accepts requests from Channel-X of the following types: HotelRatePlanInventoryNotif, HotelRatePlanNotif, HotelAvailNotif.
You will find detailed information and examples of each method in the Messages section. In Code List you will find all codes used by the system.

        Generic What is the timezone displayed in the messages?
Time zone is always UTC.
HotelRatePlanInventoryNotif, HotelRatePlanNotif and HotelAVailNotif all include another message called &amp;ldquo;Derived&amp;rdquo;. What is a Derived rate and what is its purpose?
A derived rate is a rate that has derived from its base rate, but you can change its condition so that you can present it as a discounted rate or some sort of offer. In the derived rate message you will also see a RateBasePlanCode.
