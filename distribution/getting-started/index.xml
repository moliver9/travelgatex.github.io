        Distribution-X distinguishes up to 3 levels in which we can organize product distribution: in each of these levels we can establish a set of rules, or even inherit them.
The entire set of rules and their operation are described in the documentation for the Rules Management Extranet. Please check Rules Management. Organization: 1st level The 1st level is the so-called “organization” and would be equivalent to a Distribution-X customer (not a buyer/client who comes to TravelgateX platform to buy, but the company that has contracted the Distribution-X module to distribute its product).

        Distribution-X is made up of the following elements. For more detail, please refer to the specific documentation for each component.
Selling API This API provides different transactions that are part of the reservation flow and also includes transactions to obtain the static information. Therefore, it is the API that buyers / clients will use.
This is the API that contains the Core of Distribution-X: it is in charge of applying all the distribution rules, closing and cancelling reservations (and storing them) and also allows basic reservation queries.
