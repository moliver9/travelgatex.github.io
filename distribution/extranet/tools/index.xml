        Reports return CSV files with information about your product. Currently there is a report of a Hotels Blacklist, Suppliers Blacklist and Hotels Report. This first one also includes information on why these hotels are on the blacklist (if it is by blacklisted destination, chain, market&amp;hellip;).
We can generate as many reports as we want, but there is a restriction of one every 5 minutes per type of report, and they last 3 months until deleted.
