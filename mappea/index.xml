        Our reference pages explain all aspects of our GraphQL schema.
These pages are divided into the following sections:
Schema: Explains how our Schema works and the two key operations: Queries and Mutations
Objects: A complete list of all objects in our schema, their definitions, what fields they use and when they are mandatory.
role=&amp;ldquo;alert&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;We are currently building out examples for every Object page. Please send us a Pull request if you would like to see an example for a particular Object, or if you would like to share your own example with the TravelgateX community.
